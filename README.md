## 📖 Introduction

**reBot-DevArm (reBot Arm B601 DM and reBot Arm B601 RS)** is a robotic arm project dedicated to lowering the barrier to learning Embodied AI. We focus on **"True Open Source"** — not just the code, we unreservedly open source everything:
- 🦾 **Two versions of the robotic arm**：We will provide all open-source files for two versions of the robotic arm with the same appearance: **Robostride** and **Damiao**.
- 🛠️ **Hardware Blueprints**: Source files for sheet metal parts and 3D printed parts.
- 🔩 **BOM List**: Detailed down to the specifications and purchase links for every single screw.
- 💻 **Software & Algorithms**: Python SDK, ROS1/2, Isaac Sim, LeRobot, etc.

## Get Your Own reBot Arm

## Rights and Restrictions

Dear developers and industry experts, the reBot Arm robotic arm project has always adhered to the core philosophy of **Agility, Openness, Responsibility, and Symbiosis** to serve the developer community. Our vision is to enable every enthusiast to systematically master the hardware architecture and software principles of robotic arms, and to gain an immersive experience with cutting-edge embodied intelligence algorithms through the reBot project.

For the first five months since launch, the project has been using the **CC BY-SA NC (Non-Commercial) open source license**. The original intention was to allow all developers and contributors to focus on iterating and improving the product during its initial, less mature phase, free from commercial concerns, and to fully dedicate themselves to project co-construction and optimization.

After months of in-depth product polishing and technical refinement by Seeed Studio, **effective May 11, 2026**, the reBot Arm project has officially transitioned from the CC BY-SA NC license to the **CERN-OHL-W 2.0 open source license**.

From this point forward, the project achieves **100% full-stack open source (both hardware and software), granting full commercial compliance and usage rights for all scenarios**.

We look forward to your continued participation with an inclusive and collaborative spirit, to sustain, maintain, and deepen the reBot Arm open source community, to share the fruits of open source, and together build an ecosystem for embodied intelligence.

This project uses different open source licenses for Hardware and Software. Please confirm the license terms applicable to the part you are using.
